# Hangman
Hangman is an interactive, text-based Python game where the computer randomly selects a word and the player must guess it one letter at a time. 
With a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed, each wrong guess brings the player closer to a loss. 
The game displays the word with unguessed letters as underscores and provides feedback after each guess, making it a fun and challenging way to test your word-guessing skills.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection:** The game chooses a word at random from a predefined pool.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players are prompted to guess letters and receive real-time feedback.
- **Limited Guesses:** Players have a fixed number of attempts (7 guesses) to solve the word.
- **Dynamic Word Reveal:** Correct guesses update the displayed word, revealing the letter(s) in their proper positions.
- **User Guidance:** A welcome message explains the rules and how to play.
